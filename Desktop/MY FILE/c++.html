     <h2> EXPLAIN IN DETAIL ABOUT C++</h2>
   <b> <i>  C++ (c plus plus) is a high level programming language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs. c++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor,c. c++is one of the most popular programming language for graphical applications, such as those that run in the windows and macintosh environments.</i></b>

<B>Advantages and Disadvantages of C++</B><br>
<left><b>ADVANTAGES:-</B><br>
1. object oriented<br>
2.portable language<br>
3.low level language like assembly language on machine language called portable.<br>
4.c++ is compatible with c.<br>
5.c++ use inheritance,polymorphism.<br>
<b>DISADVANTAGES:-<br></b>
1. it has less security.<br>
2. c++ has a bootable.<br>
3. complex in very large high-level program.<br>
4. c++ cannot support garbage collection.<br>
<align="left"><B>USES:-</B><br>
USES OF C++ allows procedural PROGRAMMING language for intensive functions of cpu and to provide control over hardware , and this LANGUAGE is very fast because of which it is widely used in developing different games or in gaming engines. C++ is mainly used in  developing the suits of the game tool.<br>
<B>LIMITATIONS OF C++:-</B><br>
1. Does not provide efficient means for garbage collection.<br>
2. No built in support for threads.<br>
3. Portability of code on various platforms,etc.<br>
